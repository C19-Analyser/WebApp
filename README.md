## C9-Analyser webApp V2

To compile it you must create a python 3.8 virtual environemment. Python 2.X and python 3.9 will not work. 

Follow the next instructions :

1. Open a terminal and go to the directory where you want to work.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Go to the root of the new directory.
4. Create virtualenv with python3.8 => **!Important!**
5. Activate the virtual env.
6. Install all requirements with pip and the file requierements.txt.
7. Run server.py
8. You can access to the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (loacalhost)

For the moment this application can only differentiate between X-ray images of healthy and covid patients. It will be updated soon. 
The final goal is to be able to integrate this tool to the ascl√©pia web applications via a microservice architecture.
